# webpack-babel-react-hackathon-boilerplate

This repo is a small boilerplate for a react/babel/webpack project.

## features

- Develop with React, ES6 & Babel 6
- Lint with [Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard)
- Build with Webpack
- Enjoy [hot module replacement](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html)

## usage

To get started:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ahoskins/webpack-babel-react-hackathon-boilerplate react-boilerplate
$ cd react-boilerplate
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

A hot reloading webpack-dev-server is launched on localhost:8080.  Make changes in the `app/` directory, save, and watch the rendered web page update.

To lint using Standard:

```bash
$ npm run lint  
```

To build and deploy for production:

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run deploy
```

A while ago, I made a [different boilerplate](https://github.com/ahoskins/browserify-react-node-hackathon-boilerplate) using browserify.
